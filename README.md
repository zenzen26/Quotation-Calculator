# Quotation-Calculator
This is an Excel sheet set up for my work at Flash Media Solutions. It helps us to auto finalise the quotation prices for each clients including items cost, freight charges, and other miscellaneous services or charges.

At the end of the sheet, users can also screenshot the final quotation form. The need for final form is to hide the hidden mark up charges.

This does not involve the usage of VBA code, hence,the workaround of the final form. By using VBA, this Excel sheeet could have straight away generated a final quotation without the awkward filter and repetitive display.

Disclaimer: The hidden charges and value written in the Excel are merely a dummy data for demo purposes. It does not reflect to what Flash Media Solution do.
